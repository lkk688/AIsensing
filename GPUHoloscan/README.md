# NVIDIA Holoscan Sensor Bridge with FPGA

Technical documentation, setup instructions, and implementation details for working with the **NVIDIA Holoscan Sensor Bridge** based on a **Lattice ECP5 FPGA** platform. The system enables high-speed, low-latency sensor data streaming‚Äîsuch as from ADCs and RF transceivers‚Äîto NVIDIA GPUs via 10GbE, facilitating real-time processing pipelines for edge AI and medical applications.

## üì¶ Overview

NVIDIA Holoscan is a modular, low-latency data processing framework designed for sensor AI workloads. The **Sensor Bridge** is a companion hardware system designed to ingest sensor data (e.g., from ADI RF frontends via FMC connectors), buffer and format it in an FPGA, and stream it to NVIDIA GPUs over 10Gb Ethernet.

This README outlines:

- Setup and usage of the Holoscan Sensor Bridge hardware
- FPGA IP overview and customization
- ADC/transceiver data acquisition from FMC to GPU
- Links to development resources and open-source repositories

## üöÄ System Architecture

```text
+-----------------+     FMC      +------------------+     10GbE      +------------------+
| ADI Transceiver | <==========> | Lattice FPGA     | <===========> | NVIDIA GPU Host  |
| (ADC/DAC)       |              | (Sensor Bridge)  |                | (Holoscan SDK)   |

```

Data Flow:
	1.	Sensor Input: ADC data (e.g., from Analog Devices AD-FMCDAQ2) is input through FMC interface.
	2.	FPGA Processing: FPGA captures data via FMC interface, optionally applies pre-processing (decimation, reordering), and buffers it in internal BRAM/DDR.
	3.	10GbE Transmission: Data is packetized and streamed out using the onboard 10GbE MAC/PHY via UDP.
	4.	GPU Reception: NVIDIA Holoscan SDK receives the data in a GXF pipeline and forwards it to GPU memory for real-time processing.

üîß Hardware Setup

Refer to NVIDIA Holoscan Sensor Bridge hardware guide:

üìÑ Sensor Bridge Hardware Setup

Key Components:
	‚Ä¢	FPGA Board: Lattice ECP5-based development board

üß† FPGA IP Overview

Refer to the official IP list:
üìÑ Sensor Bridge IP Catalog

Notable IP blocks:

IP Core	Description
FMC Interface	Captures LVDS parallel or serial (JESD204B) data from ADCs
Data Formatter	Applies bit reordering, channel multiplexing, metadata tagging
10GbE MAC/PHY	Handles UDP encapsulation and 10GbE transmission
AXI Stream Bridge	Connects core logic to external DRAM or streaming interface
Clock Generator	Provides PLL-based clocks for JESD or LVDS capture
Control Register	Memory-mapped registers for configuration and runtime control


‚∏ª

üîÑ ADC/FMC Integration Guide

Step-by-Step: Getting ADC Data to GPU
	1.	Hardware Connection
	‚Ä¢	Connect an ADI FMC-compatible ADC (e.g., AD-FMCDAQ2) to the Sensor Bridge FMC port.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure proper clocking (either from the ADC or provided to it).
	2.	FPGA Configuration
	‚Ä¢	Build the bitstream using Lattice Radiant or Diamond with IP cores configured for your ADC.
	‚Ä¢	Configure JESD204B or parallel interface for the ADC on FMC.
	3.	UDP Data Stream
	‚Ä¢	Configure packet size, sample format, and stream rate in the Control Register block.
	‚Ä¢	Data is transmitted over 10GbE using a UDP stream formatted as expected by the Holoscan operator.
	4.	Host Machine
	‚Ä¢	On the Jetson AGX Orin or x86 GPU host:
	‚Ä¢	Use Holoscan SDK‚Äôs VideoStreamReplayer or UDPReceiverOp to capture packets.
	‚Ä¢	Connect to downstream operators or models via the GXF graph.

## Problems

Unlike larger FPGA vendors like Xilinx and Intel (Altera), Lattice:
	‚Ä¢	Does not provide JESD204B/C IP cores as part of its default IP catalog for the ECP5 or CrossLink-NX families.
	‚Ä¢	Has no JESD204 IP mentioned in official Radiant or Diamond toolchains.

According to NVIDIA‚Äôs documentation, the Holoscan FPGA samples and IPs target parallel or LVDS interfaces, not JESD204.

‚úÖ Workarounds / Community & Third-Party Solutions

To implement JESD204 interfaces with Lattice FPGAs, you have three options:
	1.	Use ADCs with Parallel LVDS Interface Instead
	‚Ä¢	ADI (Analog Devices) provides FMC boards (e.g., AD9645, AD7961) that use parallel LVDS or CMOS output instead of JESD204.
	‚Ä¢	The Holoscan Sensor Bridge does support LVDS interfacing, and NVIDIA provides IPs and examples for those in the Lattice environment.

Use External JESD-to-LVDS Bridge
	‚Ä¢	Some system designs use an intermediate ASIC or FPGA to convert JESD204 output from ADC to a parallel or simpler interface the Lattice FPGA can handle.
	‚Ä¢	This adds complexity and latency but is a valid approach.

## üìÇ Using Xilinx ZCU102
Using the Xilinx ZCU102 board to interface with an ADI ADC via JESD204, and stream the captured data to an NVIDIA GPU via 10GbE, is very feasible and robust ‚Äî especially since Xilinx provides JESD204 IP and ADI provides verified JESD204 reference designs.

Here‚Äôs a structured guide to building such a pipeline:

‚∏ª

üîß System Overview

+----------------------+     JESD204B     +--------------------+     10GbE      +------------------+
| ADI FMC ADC Board    | <=============> | Xilinx ZCU102       | <===========> | NVIDIA GPU Host  |
| (e.g., AD9680, etc.) |                 | (JESD + UDP Stream) |                | (UDP Receiver)   |
+----------------------+                 +--------------------+                +------------------+

	‚Ä¢	ADI HDL GitHub: https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl
	‚Ä¢	Supported Boards: AD-FMCDAQ2, AD9680, AD9208 + ZCU102

To build the design:
	1.	Clone the ADI HDL repo:

git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/hdl.git
cd hdl/projects/daq2/zcu102


	2.	Use Make or Vivado GUI to build the project:

make


	3.	This design:
	‚Ä¢	Instantiates Xilinx JESD204 IP (PHY + LINK + Transport)
	‚Ä¢	Receives data from ADC via FMC
	‚Ä¢	Maps data into AXI-stream or memory

‚∏ª

üåê Step 3: Add 10GbE UDP Streaming Logic

Option A: Use Xilinx CMAC + UDP Packetizer (Vivado IP + HLS or RTL)
	1.	Insert CMAC IP
	‚Ä¢	Use the 10G/25G CMAC Subsystem or 10G Ethernet Subsystem IP
	‚Ä¢	Connect to your data source (AXI stream from JESD receiver)
	2.	Add UDP Packetizer
	‚Ä¢	Custom logic or HLS:
	‚Ä¢	Wrap JESD samples in UDP packets
	‚Ä¢	Add appropriate headers (Ethernet + IP + UDP)
	‚Ä¢	Inject into CMAC‚Äôs TX stream
	3.	MAC Address and IP Configuration
	‚Ä¢	Use AXI-lite to set IP, port, MAC in CMAC wrapper
	‚Ä¢	Use either static or dynamically configured UDP parameters

‚∏ª

üñ•Ô∏è Step 4: Host-Side GPU UDP Receiver

Option A: Use Holoscan SDK or Custom GStreamer Pipeline

On the host (Jetson or x86):
	1.	Set up UDP capture:
	‚Ä¢	With Holoscan:

class UdpReceiverOp(Operator):
    ...


	‚Ä¢	Or with GStreamer:

gst-launch-1.0 udpsrc port=9000 ! application/x-raw,format=... ! appsink


	2.	Forward packets to GPU:
	‚Ä¢	Use CUDA buffer or Holoscan MemoryResource to zero-copy transfer
